## Research on News Consumption
In this study, we are interested in understanding how people browse the news. To this end, we built the Informfully news app as a first prototype of a news aggregator that we are still developing. We now want to test how well this prototype works and how people integrate it into their daily news routine. Therefore, your participation is invaluable for the product we are working on.
